## Important points
1. It took me 9 hours to finished up all the project. As the exercise time limit was 8 hours, I prefer to stop. I delivered all features on my document, but some part of the code could be better. I will let you know in the session "What can be better".
2. The answer data is in sessionStorage. I created very simple and tiny API mock layer to save it.
3. The app was really enough to don't need global state. I create one just to let you know how I would approach an easy global state. 

## Code hours

My code hours were divided like this:

* Layout / components / containers - 6 hours
* Global state - 1 hour
* Unit tests - 1 hour
* Logic and API - 1 hour
